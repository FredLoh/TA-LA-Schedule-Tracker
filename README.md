This project seeks to make it easier for students to look up when Teaching and Learning Assistants for their course have their Office/Help hours.

##Repo Organization/Documentation Location:
The main directory of the repo contains test files, the PDF submissions for the assignments, our SQL file and several other files kept there for reference (For instance, a file containing example SQL queries that was used while developing the PHP files).

The **Openshift-App** folder contains the PHP files used to extract data from our MySQL server to a JSON output (to_json.php), as well as the results of running doxygen on to_json. Note that  To_JSONDoxygen.pdf contains the output of our documentation in PDF format.

The **iOS/TALATracker** folder contains all of the code and files used for the mobile application/iphone version of our project.

The **images** folder contains a variety of vector images, to be used in our final presentation as well as potentially in our application itself.

Finally, the **text-to-table-input-test** contains the code for an early attempt to interface with our MySQL server, which we have kept around for the sake of potential future reference.

##How to build/run/test code:
Because our project is spread out over several languages and a hosting service, it is difficult to build in a concise manner. The file TADatabase.sql contains our SQL's structure, and sending that file into MySQL provides test data as well that can be used with out unit tests (contained in to_json_test.php). to_json, another major component of our project, does not require building and again can be tested in the same manner as above.

In order to build and test the iOS component of the code a Mac and Xcode are required.  Simply clone the directory and open up the **.xcworkspace**, then use **Command + U** to run Unit tests and **Command + R** to run the app in the simulator.

Another method to testing the project, and an integral aspect, is being able to post to to_json.php to retrieve usable JSON from the database. In order to be able to accomplish this the database had to be hosted along with the php to query it. OpenShift is a Platform-as-a-Service that was decided on because of broad support and functionality. It gave an easy method for deployment and testing. The README included in the **Openshift-App** folder has more information on this, along with a link to give input to the PHP file via an html POST. Currently there are 9 functions supported by the PHP file, the documentation (located in **Openshift-App**) generated by Doxygen can be referenced for their usage.
